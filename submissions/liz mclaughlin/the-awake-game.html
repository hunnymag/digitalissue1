            <p>My Dearest Love
                <br>you’re probably well acquainted with the Nights of Disquiet
                <br>walking in the early winter dark
                <br>when the sun drops at 5 pm
                <br>and it feels like you could <em>Run and Run and Run</em>
                <br>leaping over the collapsing horizon
                <br>coming across no one</p>
            <p>and now my Mind is spinning such that
                <br>the World must be spinning too,
                <br>faster now I think, faster
                <br>everything is ripping out the soil
                <br>and I’m clinging with waning static force
                <br>when the Walk Sign starts blinking</p>
            <p>there are Two Cyclists at the intersection
                <br>in moments they melt
                <br>away down the Avenue</p>
            <p>I can feel my head dropping
                <br>lower toward the soil
                <br>where do we go from Here</p>
