            <h2>Poughkeepsie</h2>

        <div class="entry-body">
            <p>Dawn breaks like an egg on the highway,
                <br>Light spilling through the trees to rest on the blue
                <br>bruised half-moons beneath her eyes. She keeps
                <br>her foot against the pedal, one hand in the fold
                <br>of her jacket pocket. Her cell phone buzzes, her gut
                <br>twists, and his voice echoes: <em>"a house, a yard, maybe a dog"</em></p>
            <p>The phone cracks against the side door, falling by dog-
                <br>-eared roadmaps. Drowning the call with the roar of the highway,
                <br>she wants for inner concrete: decisively gutting
                <br>the crust of the earth in a permanent band. But as the sky swallows more blue,
                <br>sun exposes the worry-soaked fold
                <br>lines where her fingers met her knuckles, empty of the ring he kept</p>
            <p>hidden for three months in a bran cereal box. He knew she kept
                <br>to a breakfast of day-old Chinese food instead, doggedly
                <br>digging in matte white boxes. His laughter lines peeked over the centerfold
                <br>of the Sunday newspaper, as she surfaced from digital superhighways
                <br>with the next crossword line: scrawled in bleeding ink by her blue
                <br>tinged fingers. She supposed that morning he finally found the guts.</p>
            <p>His words fell smooth, easy on the first swallow but her gut
                <br>anguished at their weight, her insides better kept
                <br>to the easy promises, the favor-making, secret-keeping, dog-
                <br>walking kind she could shrug to. The something old, new, borrowed, blue
                <br>demanded will, boxed and taped and wrapped in the folds
                <br>of white tissue paper. She hit the highway</p>
            <p>6 hours ago, the ring in her jacket pocket, jumping with NY State Highway
                <br>55 as it bent toward a familiar exit. Memories: her mother gutting
                <br>duck with chicken bone scissors. The clean press of folded
                <br>bed linens, aired out in the oak-thick yards of Poughkeep-
                <br>-sie. Her car idled outside the colonial, the shutters still blue.
                <br>A black lab lay sleeping on the steps: <em>"a house, a yard, maybe a dog"</em></p>
            <p>Her phone shuddered on the floor and the dog
                <br>barked. She set her bald tires rolling again to the highway,
                <br>her thoughts still of the egg-yolk kitchen against her father's dirt-caked boots, his blue
                <br>collar sensibilities, and the contented swell of his gut.
                <br>He was of similar flex and shrug as she, but never went a day without keeping
                <br>a family photo tucked into his front pocket fold.</p>
            <p>Her folded fingers unfurled in her own pocket, slow, like growing Kentucky bluegrass.
                <br>Playing with the ring, she felt in her gut a warm peace — <em>a house, a yard, a dog</em> —
                <br>She worked the band round the knuckle-crease as tires spun, down the highway and out Poughkeepsie.</p>
