            <p>"My body is so gross I want to cry."
                <br>A friend's thoughts, like a stampede of spiders,
                <br>Crawl through my gut as I sit beside her.
                <br>I say "Not true!"" Stamp the bugs. But her eyes
                <br>Close with conviction. How can I do more?
                <br>Well, I do less. Listen — hear her cadence,
                <br>Embrace every word til we find valence.
                <br>Her eyes lift and we just sit on the floor.</p>
            <p>She showed me a facet of trust more tender
                <br>Than blind belief in words' veracity.
                <br>To turn my ears away — how would I see?
                <br>If you place in my hands your secret grief,
                <br>I won't be repulsed, I won't run or flip,
                <br>But with upturned palms, so gently I'll grip.</p>
