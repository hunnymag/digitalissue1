            <p>Disney Princesses. Everyone knows them, children love them, and different people have different takes on them. In the most classic sense, Disney princesses are often critiqued for the unrealistic beauty and lifestyle ideals that they promote through their character designs and how their stories play out. With this in mind, we decide to take the idea of Disney Princesses and put a spin on how they are viewed, looking at the ways that each of them can be representative of mental disorders and societal issues. But within this, we wanted to keep the beauty that is still an undeniable part of human nature even when people are outside of societal and social norms, proving that we can be at our fairest when we fall.</p>
            <p><em>Note:</em> We are not attempting to romanticism any of these issues, we are simply trying to bring attention to them. If we offend anyone by any of these images at all, we are sincerely sorry.</p>
