        <div class="entry-body">
            <p><strong>R:</strong> Rose Amer<br><strong>L:</strong> Lindsay Amer</p>
            <p><strong>R:</strong> Tell the good people of Hunny who you are. And your pronouns.</p>
            <p><strong>L:</strong> She/her/hers, Lindsay Amer (pronounced aim-er, just so you know).</p>
            <p><strong>R:</strong> Ah yes, good good. I didn’t know that. [Just kidding! I did know that! It’s also my last name!]</p>
            <p>L: I’m the creator and host of Queer Kid Stuff, which is an LGBT educational video series for kids. And I’m also the co-artistic director and founding member of Bluelaces Theater Company.</p>
            <p>R: Which is?</p>
            <p>L: Titles titles titles. We create multi-sensory, immersive, theatrical experiences for individuals on the Autism Spectrum and with developmental differences.</p>
            <p>R: That’s a mouthful.</p>
            <p>L:  That’s our mission.</p>
            <p>R: That’s a good mission, as far as missions go.</p>
            <p>R: So yeah, for people who are not aware, we are siblings.</p>
            <p>L: Oh, yeah.</p>
            <p>R: Yep. Queer Kid Stuff - going really well so far! Lots of views.</p>
            <p>L: Yes, yeah, we’re at like 4K right now. Which is kind of crazy. I’ve gotten some pretty decent publicity out of it, which is why the views are good. I had an article on <a href="http://www.autostraddle.com/team-pick-queer-kid-stuff-brings-fun-lgbtq-videos-to-preschool-children-340096/" target="_blank">Autostraddle</a>, which is like an indie lesbian online magazine. That a lot of lesbians read. I was also featured in <a href="http://www.curvemag.com/Culture/Queer-Kid-Stuff-Is-The-New-Educational-LBGTQ-Webseries-For-Kids-1165/" target="_blank">Curve Magazine</a>, that was one of the first things that covered it. They’re also a lesbian online magazine.</p>
            <p>R: Those lesbians love their content.</p>
            <p>L: Yeah, and I think it helps having a queer lady behind and in front of the camera. My analytics have been telling me mostly women have been watching my video.</p>
            <p>R: Well, that’s all those lesbians.</p>
            <p>L: That’s the big coverage...My target audience is kids, but most of the time kids have to watch things through their parents, and teachers, and the adults in their lives. The ultimate goal is for kids to be able to find the video themselves, but they’re obviously not reading any of these publications that I’m getting publicity from. So right now, what I’m working on is spreading the word and hopefully getting algorithms to pick up the video and I need to hunker down and spend a lot of time on boosting the Search Engine Optimization stuff. But that’s a big project because it’s a lot of tech guru stuff that I don’t have expertise in, but is something I’m learning about. And YouTube has a whole other SEO thing, so it’s a lot of tech leg work on that end from my part. But that’s what will ultimately be the most rewarding, because kids are on YouTube. Kids are, like, legitimately on YouTube. And they can definitely find it, I just need to help them.</p>
            <p>R: So you’re ultimate vision – obviously this is educational content – but the purpose of these videos is for kids who are just sitting at home on their laptops, who are just curious?</p>
            <p>L: Kind of, yeah. I don’t know, it’s really surprising how many kids just don’t know what the word “gay” is. Or like “lesbians” or anything within a queer vocabulary.</p>
            <p>R: There’s a lot of stuff in the queer vocabulary that I don’t know.</p>
            <p>L: Yeah, and like, all that stuff is around you all the time every day, even if you don’t realize it. And so if a kid walks by someone who just says the word “Gay” and they ask, “Mom what does ‘gay’ mean?” and mom doesn’t tell them, the kid is still gonna be asking why, what, how, when, where. And they have the internet at their fingertips now, so they’re gonna google it: “what does ‘gay’ mean?” That’s literally what a child who can type will type.</p>
            <p>R: And what comes up when you search that?</p>
            <p>L: A dictionary definition, and resources that are for parents and teachers.</p>
