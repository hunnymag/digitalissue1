            <h2>Good Mornings</h2>
            <h3 class="centered-title"><span>by Noor Hasan</span></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="entry-body">
            <p>You are 22 years old in your first office job after college.
                <br>You have moved back home with your parents
                <br>You spend eight hours in a cubicle for approximately 230 days a year plus or minus bathroom breaks and overtime.
                <br>Everyone around you watches their income burn away into rent, food, gas money, bills, and insurance.
                <br>You work for insurance.
                <br>There is a woman who sits thirteen seats away and wishes you good morning every day.
                <br>You wish everyone good morning every day,
                <br>even when it's not.
                <br>You exchange a few words daily, 
                <br>nothing too meaningful because everyone here 
                <br>and everyone everywhere is running late 
                <br>for meetings and deadlines that are never urgent to begin with.</p>
            <p>One week, you notice something disrupted from your routine.
                <br>When every morning starts with oatmeal, 
                <br>a 22-minute commute, 
                <br>washing your coffee mug in the office sink, 
                <br>a series of click-deletes in your inbox, 
                <br>and a good morning, 
                <br>you notice when the details drift.
                <br>It has been four days since a good morning from the woman who sits thirteen seats away. 
                <br>You wonder if she's on vacation, traveling maybe. 
                <br>You shoo the thought to the back of your mind and 
                <br>click-drag-delete-click-drag-delete-click-drag-delete 
                <br>until the head of the department sends a meeting notice 
                <br>to all 104 people on this floor that will be taking place in the next 5 minutes.</p>
            <p>The "good morning" lady will no longer sit thirteen seats away 
                <br>because she died over the weekend of a rare, undetected spinal infection.
                <br>Some people cry, most
                <br>stare aimlessly at the projector on the ceiling,
                <br>and scurry out to their remaining meetings and deadlines that are never urgent to begin with.
                <br>The only rational response to this news is to
                <br>go to Target on your lunch break and populate your shopping cart 
                <br>with silverware, rugs, and china 
                <br>that you will take to a hypothetical new house in a new city you find on a Forbes list about
                <br>the &quot;10 happiest cities for millennials.&quot;
                <br>You will watch old people in their cars pick their noses on the commute home
                <br>and wonder how long it will be before they die.
                <br>You will peel this death away from your mind like the shell off a hard-boiled egg
                <br>and carry on the next day 
                <br>with your good mornings.</p>
