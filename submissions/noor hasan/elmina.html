            <p>Karamagi Rujumba listed Elmina Castle in Cape Coast, Ghana as a "destination spotlight."
                <br>Memorable, impersonal, souvenir, picturesque in ways Kumasi could never be.
                <br>A hub of leftover ivory towers,
                <br>brilliant blue, transatlantic accommodations,
                <br>oceanfront view but only three stars:</p>
            <p>Bone fragments line the brick floors
                <br>The archaeologists refuse to wash them away.
                <br>Blood trickles into the cracks of cement as if the blacktop has ridges and lifelines.
                <br>This inconvenience is regretted.</p>
            <p>The Portuguese came in 1482 to scatter a diaspora that would never recall itself.
                <br>Guilt and recollection is buried somewhere at sea but
                <br>the tour guide will take your picture for you.</p>
            <p>Refundable fare if you canâ€™t understand him speaking
                <br>of chains and chucked ropes, slums and wooden shacks,
                <br>the dark residue in watch-your-step dungeons, of how easy it is
                <br>to rest your feet for just a moment at the base of a rusted cannon - lean your body on it
                <br>and the sub-Saharan sun will delay your realization
                <br>of what they used canons for here,
                <br>of ancestry that has collapsed like the orange roof of Elmina Castle,
                <br>of why the people who live on Cape Coast have the fairest skin in West Africa,
                <br>of what man has been capable of, of what man is still capable of</p>
            <p>Today when you pass the door of no return,
                <br>fishermen and textile workers squat with their feet buried in the wet sand.
                <br>The coastal economy bustles on as its history is still screaming.</p>
