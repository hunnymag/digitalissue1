            <p>If you die a young woman with child in this land,
                <br>There are things that must be done to keep you from becoming a vengeful spirit – a <em>churail</em>.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Bury her face down with care.</li>
                <li>Remember her with devotional songs.</li>
                <li>Pray for her.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle thousands of mustard seeds on her grave so that if she rises, in lieu of returning home, she is preoccupied with counting them.</li>
                <li>Scatter cotton on the roads of the funeral procession.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If only the people in this village buried me out of love, not fear of what I may become.</p>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief,
                <br>I do not drain the blood of people who roam <em>Jheel Park</em> after <em>maghrib</em>.
                <br>I do not wail at the stars earthquaking above,
                <br>howl at the living nor screeching among the dead.
                <br>I am almost certain that I am a ghoul translated from lands far.</p>
            <p style="text-align:right">How many stamps does Folklore have in its passport?</p>
            <p>I have heard that they call me <em>La Llorona</em> in the West,</p>
            <p style="text-align:center"><em>Banshee</em> in the North</p>
            <p style="text-align:right">and <em>Onryo</em> in the Far East.</p>
            <p>I am not beautiful from afar and ghastly up close.
                <br>I wandered these streets for three hundred and thirty years
                <br>before your children and cattle defecated on them.
                <br>The men is this town chew so much <em>paan</em>
                <br>they see all kinds of terrible things that do not exist
                <br>but never the things that do:</p>
            <p style="text-align:center">the transactions of love and bodies,
                <br>assaults on the back of buses,</p>
            <p>Shame: the heirloom for women
                <br>Power: the treasure of man</p>
            <p style="text-align:center">dishonorable daughters buried in backyards.</p>
            <p>At midnight,
                <br>the hair at the nape of your neck rises only at tales of goblins hiding in the trees,
                <br>luring men off the shoulders of dirt roads
                <br>but not the monsters that live among you.</p>
            <p>Save your goosebumps for the killers, thieves,
                <br>the rapists, your oligarchy of shapeshifting politicians,
                <br>the monsters in your <em>galli</em> with names that don’t go gendered by allegories.</p>
            <p>When the veil of night drapes Karachi, think not of me.
                <br>When the dirt roads are bare mute, think not of me.
                <br>When the <em>mosque and the mandirs</em> empty at sundown, think not of me.
                <br>Think not of me. Think not of me. Think not of me.</p>
