            <h2>The Quiet After Isha</h2>
            <h3 class="centered-title"><span>by Noor Hasan</span></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="entry-body">
            <p>It was not typically this quiet after <em>isha</em> prayer.</p>
            <p>As Abid rounded the corner to our house, 
                <br>the streetlights on the D Block of Model Town clicked awake, 
                <br>dusk deepened, and a glossy summer moon beamed 
                <br>over Lahore, lighting the mud path home.</p>
            <p>He smiled small, thumb in mouth 
                <br>clutching Amma’s green dupatta 
                <br>with hands blistered from the spring kite festival, 
                <br>unaware of what would soon unsettle him.</p>
            <p>The <em>buckbuckbuck</em> of Amma’s chickens were 
                <br>our musical breadcrumbs on the walk home from the <em>masjid</em>. 
                <br>They would peck playfully at our feet as we pushed the gate open. 
                <br>Abid’s favorite was a small white hen. 
                <br>Eyes as dark as his, her chest fluffed in his lap 
                <br>and him babbling along with her <em>buckbuck</em>.</p>
            <p>But tonight, 
                <br>Amma tapped the gate open, 
                <br>And under the yawning charcoal sky, 
                <br>her hand dripped with their blood.</p>
            <p>Heads and wings scattered in the grass, 
                <br> thighs sunken in the mud – still erect from the blow: a poultry warzone. 
                <br>Fauzia auntie peered over the bloodied fence and yelled,</p>
                <p style="text-align:right">
                    <br><em>"Chor teri murghiyan leh gaye!"</em> 
                    <br>Thieves had stolen the chickens from our yard
                    <br>while we were praying in the <em>masjid</em>.</p>
            <p>Abid found his companion.
                <br>The white hen once as glossy as the summer moon,
                <br>the fluff of her white neck indistinguishable from blood and dirt.
                <br>After the incident in our backyard on D Block,
                <br>Abid did not eat chicken for six years.</p>
            <p>Later, we heard that they had sold the meat in a market,
                <br>and I wondered how it could ever be halal
                <br>to slaughter stolen flesh,
                <br>to bless it with God’s name,
                <br>to steal a poor woman’s chickens from her yard as she begs Him for salvation.</p>
            <p>In the quiet after <em>Isha</em>,
                <br>I realized that if a man could steal chickens from a poor woman’s yard
                <br>Bless its flesh with an <em>Allahu Akbar</em>
                <br>And sell it down the block from her house,
                <br>Then I could no longer care for <em>zabiha</em> meat.</p>
