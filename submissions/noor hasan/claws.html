            <h2>Claws</h2>

        <div class="entry-body">
            <p>I never found the memes about the GOP funny.
                <br>But they became unbearable when my aunt called me crying,
                <br>Her English breaking in the receiver as she told me
                <br>that a white boy clawed at my 12-year- old cousin Safiyy’s face on the bus ride home from school,
                <br>And called him a terrorist until he screamed bloody murder at the bus driver to intervene,
                <br>By then, this boy had woke the sleeping blood out of the surface of Safiyy’s skin the way the
                <br>Republican party woke the sleeping white supremacy we thought this country had long killed.
                <br>The hate is still alive and breathing.</p>
            <p>I thought the worst things Safiyy would get picked on for in school were the same things I did:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Being bad at gym class basketball;</li>
                <li>Smelling like the food we made at home; and</li>
                <li>Kicking ass at math.</li>
            </ol>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0;">But things are worse than ever.
                <br>Until now, my family has never tried to rationalize why we live in America.
                <br>Across the Atlantic, there are craters where the burning flesh of Pakistani families
                <br>confetti down from U.S. drone strikes and we are complicit in this country:</p>
            <p class="indent-1">where we don't quite belong.
                <br>where we are told constantly that we should go back to Pakistan but the
                <br>violence of America is just as much of a threat there.
                <br>where it is almost routine that a twelve-year-old brown boy stares in horror
                <br>as he sees his own blood, glowing and sticky under the fingernails of the 
                <br>bully on the back of the bus.
                <br>where the laughter never stops when a person of color does not speak the right
                <br>dialect of white.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0;">After this poem, someone will play devil's advocate and tell me</p>
            <p class="indent-1" style="margin-bottom:0;">That this was an isolated incident,
                <br>That this bully is the exception not the rule,
                <br>That things are not this bad everywhere:</p>
            <p class="indent-2">Like I don't know America is the biggest manufacturer of fear.
                <br>Like I don't know our media works around the clock to indoctrinate unparalleled allegiance.
                <br>Like I don't know this country suffers from the same type of violent nationalism we try to topple overseas.</p>
            <p>We are the citizens of nothing but a diaspora of violence:
                <br>If we let the blood vessels on Safiyy's face break open like borders,
                <br>If we let his skin scratch so deeply that his blood can't be carried to the tissues and organs that need them,
                <br>If we let them rip his face like bombs breaking open the heart of lands until
                <br>Their bodies, histories, and the cultures are no more.</p>
            <p>Whether clawing at the borders of our homelands abroad or at our faces,
                <br>American white supremacy remains the biggest threat to safety in our lifetime.</p>
            <p>Safiyy,</p>
            <p>As your mom cries into the phone, her voice and hope for you are as broken as the blood
                <br>vessels in your skin. Your dark skin and the red stains on the brown leather seat of the bus,
                <br>of who the child who hurt you will grow up to become and if it is too late to stop him.</p>
